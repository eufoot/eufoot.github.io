We are glad to announce that the work on Europeanisation of football fandom will continue also after the end of this project. The projekt <em><a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a></em> started on Jul 1, 2021 at the Unviersity of Mainz. 

It investigates into how fan organisation, football clubs and their associations can mitigate football as basis for social cohesion in Europe. Methodologically, it builds on a mixed-methods approach and combines text as data analysis, survey methods and qualitative interviews.
